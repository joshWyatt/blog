#shine through your tech interview
*2014/07/21* - interview, psychology

Nervous yet? No worries!! We're going to dig into some really easy to learn strategies for presenting your best and most capable self during the technical interview.

####Not Your Parents

Humans tend to operate on memory. This is well-established scientifically, and has major implications (believe or not) for the interview process. Answer me this:

<i>What kind of person has to go out of their way to gain someone else's approval, immediately, in order to get the resources they need to feed and shelter themselves?</i>

If you said children, I agree. If you said someone who is interviewing for a job, I agree.

In fact the situation is so closely aligned to us on an unconscious level that we bring any and all anxiety that we might have felt as a helpless and utterly dependent child.

Recognize that all the anxiety you feel going into an interview is in fact just a memory and then breath deeply, look around the room at some of the details of the environment, and remind yourself of your actual age. Like anything, you will have to practice this, so find situations where you can trigger yourself to feel that familiar anxiety so that you can practice bringing yourself down over time.

You will get better at keeping yourself calm.


####Enter Like You Were Meant To Be Here

There will come a time to defend your position during the technical part of the interview. When you first meet your interviewer, be like an award winning actor, playing the role of knowing that they are exactly where they need to be. Everyone is happy that you've arrived.

####It's Just Your Friend

Think about that time on the train, or in the bar with a colleague when you were delighted to talk about an exciting new coding challenge. This is all you're doing in the interview.

####Draw

As soon as you start talking code you should start drawing on the white board. Assume your interviewer is going to take a picture and show it to someone else in expectation that they would be able to take some really good guesses at what you're talking about just by what is on the board. Put squares or circles around your writing, it's easier to read, and make sure if you're using data structures that you draw them in a cannonical way.

####Be Concise and Technical

Try to reduce the amount of time you spend speaking about something by using the correct and precise technical jargon. Stay on topic and don't get distracted. An interviewer will ask you to defend yourself or go deeper into a topic if the need arises.

####Make Eye Contact

And slow your voice down while you're at it. Remember you're just hanging out with your friend. Work on the feeling between you and your interviewer. Remember, they want to see your technical chops and find out if they want to spend most days hanging out with you.

####Don't Go Silent

If you don't know what to do next talk out load through your thought process and be gracious and clear when you recognize you've started to consider a wrong answer. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification and always move towards simulating your thought process on the white board. Sometimes the answer will occur to you after you've started drawing.

####Say Thanks
The interviewer's time is valuable, show appreciation.

####Practice
The more you practice the better you'll get.
Best!
