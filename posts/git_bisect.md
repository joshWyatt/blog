I had a nasty bug to track that, as it turned out, spawned its ugly head over 2 months and 300 commits ago!

I had the pleasure of learning a new tool in my epic quest to hunt it: [git bisect](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect).

[git bisect](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) is a command that allows you to use binary search to track down when your code stopped acting the way you expected it to. Check out the docs, it's very easy to use.
