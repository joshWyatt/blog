#briefly on evolution and algorithms
*2014/06/19* - code, philosophy

Evolution does not in fact care about speed or perfection. To define the optimum in nature we need context, and context changes. Also optimum always in nature shares ancestry with failure of all spectrum.

In so far as we might be interested in computational behaviour capable of mimicking, or at least accomplishing, the kinds of problems whose solutions we humans currently monopolize, it is worth considering the creation of algorithms that deemphasize speed and accuracy in exchange for unknown iteration within a partially reciprocal but also largely unknown context. Also we should not mind so much when an algorithm fails in so far as some scion of it gets to muster on.
